# Simple Shell
## Holberton Foundations Cohort 14

## Background
The Simple Shell project is the final collaborative project in the first trimester of Holberton School's Foundations. Simple shell seeks to develop, then exhibit a working proficiency with the C language, and an understanding of commonly used coding techniques and data structures. 

## Installation / Requirements
All C files present in the repository should be compiled within the same directory as the shell.h header file.
Written to be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.

## Usage
Our simple shell will function in both interactive 
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
```
and non-interactive mode (using bash scripts as below)
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
```

## Support
Please reach out to either of the authors on slack or linked in with any questions or needs. 

## Development Roadmap
We're at the end of the road, bucko
